# HOAdoor - HOA Community Platform

HOAdoor is a comprehensive platform for Homeowners Association (HOA) transparency and community management. It combines public HOA reviews and ratings with private community portals, similar to how Glassdoor works for companies but specifically designed for residential communities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for local development)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hoadoor
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. **Start local services:**
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Maildev using Docker
npm run db:up
```

4. **Set up database:**
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed with sample data
npm run db:seed
```

5. **Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
